In first Question, I did the whole website only by using HTML and CSS.
in that i did every animation and styles only by CSS(the power of CSS:)).
screen shots of all my website are included in the same folder.
!!Note: No Bootstrap or external libraries or javascript are included!!

and then, in second Question, I did whole website by backend and front end.
Third party packages installed by node.js:express,hbs(handlebars),mongoose(connecting database(mongoDB)),moment(for date&Time).
We can post our doubt by giving our credentials and by stating the subject .It captures at what date & time we posted.This data gets stored in MongoDB(in my system, its named as test). And in the 'view previous doubts' section, we can view all history of doubts by connecting to our db via mongoose.I used Express framework for whole backend.
!!Note: No Bootstrap included!!
every front end thing is made from scratch.

This work is done by me,Pamba Ravindra Mohith(210050112), honestly without copying any website or any other student's work.You cannot find these webs even in online.
